## Loan prediction machine learning project

## Introduction

In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc. The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan))

Next, we will consider loan prediction based on linear regression.

To do this, the division of the DataSet into training and test sets will be demonstrated. It will be shown how to build models using 3 different machine learning algorithms. Then we will analyze the accuracy and adequacy of the obtained models.

## Objective 
 The main objective for this dataset:[](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Loan%20Prediction%20Project/loan%20prediction%20machine%20learning%20project.ipynb#The-main-objective-for-this-dataset:)
Using machine learning techniques to predict loan payments.

## Materials and Methods

The project consists of two stages:

-   Download and preliminary analysis of data
-   Forecasting

The first stage will show you how to download data and pre-prepare it for the analysis:

-   downloading data
-   changing the data types of columns
-   grouping data
-   DataSet transformation
-   elimination of missing data

At the stage of forecasting, we will deal with the methods of building and fitting models, as well as with the automation of statistical information calculation, in particular:

-   splitting the DataSet into training and test sets
-   building models using 3 different algorithms
-   calculation of basic statistical indicators
